# BitSwan BSPump on pypy3

This represents a pypy3 (Python Just-In-Time compiler) version of BSPump container.
It is mean for high-performance deployment.

*DISCLAIMER:* Not every fuction of BSPump is available in the pypy3 container. We work hard to enable as much as possible but validate the availability first.
